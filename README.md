This basic exercise is for experiencing with classes.

The main features that were tried out here:
	- classes in different files
        - inner structures of classes (Fields, Properties, Constructor, Methods)
        - constructor overload
        - method overload
        - try out ENUM 
        - readonly field
        - try out XML as 'database'
       	- try out 'params' keyword
